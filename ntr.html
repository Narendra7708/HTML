He starred in over 300 films, predominantly in Telugu cinema, and was referred by the media as Viswa Vikhyatha Nata Sarvabhouma (transl. Universally-renowned star of acting).[2] Rao received three National Film Awards for co-producing Thodu Dongalu (1954) and Seetharama Kalyanam (1960) under National Art Theater, Madras,[3] and for directing Varakatnam (1970).[4] Known for his breakthrough performances in Raju Peda (1954) and Lava Kusa (1963),[5][6][7] Rao garnered the Nandi Award for Best Actor for Kodalu Diddina Kapuram in 1970, and the Inaugural Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu in 1972 for Badi Panthulu.[5][7]

Rama Rao made his debut as an actor in a Telugu social film Mana Desam, directed by L. V. Prasad in 1949. He gained popularity in the 1950s when he became well known for his portrayals of Hindu deities, especially Krishna, Shiva and Rama,[8] roles which have made him a "messiah of the masses", and a prominent figure in the history of cinema.[8][9] He later became known for portraying antagonistic characters and Robin Hood-esque hero characters in films.[10][11][12][13] N.
