<h1>TELEPHONE</h1>
<p>A telephone is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications">telecommunications </a>device that permits two or more users to conduct a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"> conversation</a> when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. The term is derived from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"> Greek</a>: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice. A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use early in the telephone's history.[1]</p>
<p>
In 1876, <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device.[2] This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in <a href=

<p>
The essential elements of a telephone are a<ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"> microphone</a> (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice at a distant location.[3] The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The transmitter converts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound#Waves">sound waves</a> to <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal">electrical signals</a> which are sent through the telecommunication system to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"> loudspeaker</a>. Telephones permit transmission in both directions simultaneously.</p>

<p>Before the development of the electric telephone, the term telephone was applied to other inventions, and not all early researchers of the electrical device used the term. Perhaps the earliest use of the word for a communications system was the telephon created by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sigismund_Gottfried_Huth"> Johann Sigismund Gottfried Huth</a> [de] in 1796. Huth proposed an alternative to the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe in which the operators in the signaling towers would shout to each other by means of what he called "speaking tubes", but would now be called giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaphone">megaphones</a>.[5] A communication device for sailing vessels, called telephone, was invented by Captain John Taylor in 1844. This instrument used four air horns to communicate with vessels in foggy weather.[6][7]</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Philipp_Reis">Johann Philipp Reis</a> used the term in reference to his invention, commonly known as the<ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reis_telephone"> Reis telephone</a>, in c. 1860. His device appears to be the first device based on the conversion of sound into electrical impulses.</p>

<p>The term telephone was adopted into the vocabulary of many languages. It is derived from the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"> Greek</a>: τῆλε, tēle, "far" and φωνή, phōnē, "voice", together meaning "distant voice".</p>
<h2>Timeline of early development</h2>
<blockquote><li>1844: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocenzo_Manzetti">Innocenzo Manzetti </a>first mooted the idea of a "speaking telegraph" or telephone. Use of the "speaking telegraph" and "sound telegraph" monikers would eventually be replaced by the newer, distinct name, "telephone".</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>26 August 1854:<a hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bourseul"> Charles Bourseul</a> published an article in the magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Illustration">L'Illustration</a> (Paris): "Transmission électrique de la parole" (electric transmission of speech), describing a "make-and-break" type telephone transmitter later created by Johann Reis.</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>26 October 1861:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Philipp_Reis"> Johann Philipp Reis</a> (1834–1874) publicly demonstrated the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reis_telephone"> Reis telephone</a> before the Physical Society of Frankfurt.[9] Reis's telephone was not limited to musical sounds. Reis also used his telephone to transmit the phrase "Das Pferd frisst keinen Gurkensalat" ("The horse does not eat cucumber salad").</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>22 August 1865, La Feuille d'Aoste reported "It is rumored that English technicians to whom Manzetti illustrated his method for transmitting spoken words on the telegraph wire intend to apply said invention in England on several private telegraph lines".[citation needed] However, telephones would not be demonstrated there until 1876, with a set of telephones from Bell.</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>28 December 1871:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Meucci"> Antonio Meucci</a> files <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_caveat">patent caveat</a> No. 3335 in the U.S. Patent Office, titled "Sound Telegraph", describing communication of voice between two people by wire. A patent caveat was not an invention patent award, but only an unverified notice filed by an individual that he or she intends to file a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent">patent</a> application in the future.</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>1874: Meucci, after having renewed the caveat for two years does not renew it again, and the caveat lapses.</li></blockquote>

<blockquote><li>6 April 1875: Bell's U.S. Patent 161,739 "Transmitters and Receivers for Electric Telegraphs" is granted. This uses multiple vibrating steel reeds in make-break circuits.</li></blockquote>
